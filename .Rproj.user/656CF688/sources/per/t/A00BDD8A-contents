# Class Example

A paediatrician is researching whether children wearing different types of superhero costumes are more likely to harm themselves. The severity of injury of children who have been admitted to a hospital due to superhero roll-playing is displayed in the table below. The severity of the injury is measured on a scale from 0 (no injury) to 100 (fatal). It can be assumed that the data of the different groups are normally distributed. Refer to the data in the Excel file "Superheroes.xlsx".

```{r, echo=FALSE }
setwd("D://Stellenbosch Uni//Semester2//class//Week2") # set to your own WD, that is, the main project folder
superheroes = read.table("Superheroes.csv", sep=",", header=T) #transform data from xlsx to csv



```

Investigate data structures and rewrite to the long format. In addition, we should remove the NA values.
# complete.cases true if there are no missing values, boolean variable 

```{r}
str(superheroes)
summary(superheroes)

superheroes2 = melt(superheroes, variable.name = "Costume", value.name="Injury")
superheroes2 = superheroes2[complete.cases(superheroes2),]
dim(superheroes2)

```
## Explore data visually

Explore the data with boxplots such that a boxplot is created for each costume. Add these boxplots to a single axis and adjust them so that they displayed vertically. Finally, change the order of the levels of the factor variable so that the categories are alphabetical.

# Factor is used to encode a vector as a factor


```{r}
superheroes2$Costume = factor(superheroes2$Costume, levels = c("Batman", "Spiderman", "Superman", "TheHulk"),
                              labels=c("Batman", "Spiderman", "Superman", "TheHulk"))
ggplot(superheroes2, aes(x=Injury, y=Costume, fill=Costume)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

We can improve the graph by making the boxplots descend in order of magnitude
# Basically measures the severity of each category

```{r}
superheroes2$Costume = factor(superheroes2$Costume, levels = c("Superman", "Batman", "Spiderman","TheHulk"),
                              labels=c("Superman", "Batman", "Spiderman","TheHulk"))
ggplot(superheroes2, aes(x=Injury, y=Costume, fill=Costume)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

## Question 1

Use the boxplots to discuss the validity of the assumptions for ANOVA.
 (1) We would see evidence of a normal dist with a boxplot by looking for approximately 
     symmetrical shapes within the boxplots. Evidence of Hulk,Superman and Batman of symmetrical
     whilst spiderman seems positively skewed.
     
 (2) Homoscedasticity - Wide vs narrow boxplots, width of the boxplots should more or less be of the same length. 
 
 (3) IID
 
 The form of those assumptions will change depending on the technique.
 Later on they take on form for when we assess the regression model or error
 Focus is on normality and homoscedasticity.
 
 Independence is necessary in order to do the math behind the statistical models.
 Independence is usually there when data was randomly selcted from a large population.
 Independence is very difficult to assess.
 
 Parameters come from distributions, non-parametric means so assumed distribution.
 Non-parametric tests are less powerful.
 Power is the probability to reject H0 if there is something to reject (difference)
 Non-parametric test or ANOVA is the Kruskal-Wallis test, NB in 
 "D:\\Stellenbosch  Uni\\Semester2\\class\\Week4\\NonParametrics_pt1"
 Nonparametrics replace the actual observations with the ranks and use the ranks to 
 calculate the test statistics.
 
 We won't be asked any theory about the hypothesis tests, only the application.
 Shapiro test: A measure of how well the ordered and standardized sample
               quantiles fit the standard normal quantiles.
               
 
 
## Question 2

Is there statistical evidence for costumes to cause different severity in injuries? Obtain results and discuss in depth.
 
 # This is going to be in A1
 # Amount of asterisks are indicator of levels of significance at different severities. 
 # This example specifically with the p-val states that the reject H0 at 1% significance.
 
 (1) 
```{r}

 anova(lm(Injury~Costume, superheroes2))

```
 
 (2) Getting the final ANOVA table
 
```{r}

```
 
## Assumptions

Assess normality assumption   

```{r}

lillie.test(superheroes2[superheroes2$Costume == "Superman",][,"Injury"])
lillie.test(superheroes2[superheroes2$Costume == "Spiderman",][,"Injury"])
lillie.test(superheroes2[superheroes2$Costume == "TheHulk",][,"Injury"])
lillie.test(superheroes2[superheroes2$Costume == "Batman",][,"Injury"])

shapiro.test(superheroes$Superman)
shapiro.test(superheroes$Spiderman)
shapiro.test(superheroes$TheHulk)
shapiro.test(superheroes$Batman)

```
Assess homoscedasticity assumption

```{r}
# Must be long data format

bartlett.test(formula = Injury ~ Costume, data = superheroes2)

```
There is no evidence that groups have unequal variances.

# Assumptions will be asked in A1

perform multiple comparisons

```{r}

pairwise.t.test(superheroes2$Injury, superheroes2$Costume, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

```
 We only have evidence to suggest that superman and the hulk are different at 
 the value of 0.0063.
 This will be in A1.

## Kruskal Wallis 

```{r}
KWTDat <- read.csv("KruskalTestData.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
head(KWTDat)
library(reshape2)
KrusWallTDat <- melt(KWTDat,
measure.vars = 1:ncol(KWTDat),
variable.name = 'Time',
value.name = 'Service')

kruskal.test(KrusWallTDat)
```
